Hello,
In this project I have showcased how to use @agm/core with Places autocomplete library. In order to use it, run following commands:
Run 'npm install npm', then run 'ng serve'.
AGM is a fantastic module within Angular named Anguar Google Map for working with Google Maps API. You can read more about it in it's documeentary also. For working with AGM run following commands if you are using Angular CLI: 
'npm install --save @agm/core' and 'npm install --save-dev @types/googlemaps'.
