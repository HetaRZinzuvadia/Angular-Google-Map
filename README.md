# Angular-Google-Map
I am creating this repository to push sample code projects which primaryily focuses on utilizing Angular Google Map also shortly called AGM.
Earlier working with GIS and javascript I found Leaflet very promising open-source library for mapping. But when I started with Angular, I faced difficulty in integrating plain vanilla JavaScript codes into TypeScript and sooner I came to know about AGM.

Steps for getting started with AGM:
1) get your API key for using Google Maps API from link: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
2) install @agm/core package by 'npm i --save @agm/core' command 
3) visit for more info on site as linked: https://angular-maps.com/
